      ******** TODO *********
      Temporary workaround until the 22000 SDK is shipped 
      We use WinAppSDK 1.0-experimental - this means certain types like xaml's Application are marked experimental
      There is a bug in older versions of MIDL where it doesn't understand [experimental] correctly
      This was fixed in the 22000 SDK.

      However, we can't use the 22000 because we don't have a TargetFramework for it, like net5.0-windows10.0.22000.168
