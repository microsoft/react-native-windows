The base test class has a boolean called `AutoFixLkgs` that you can set to regenerate the lkg's.
This is very useful in case there are a lot of changes in the codegen that touch a lot of tests. 
This test fails if that flag is turned on. This makes sure that nobody accidentally creates a check-in that sets the flag to true and have all the tests pass form here on out because the LKG matches");
