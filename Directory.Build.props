    Projects external to the `react-native-windows` package will resolve RNW to
    `<root>/node_nodules/react-native-windows`, which is inconsistent from the
    `<root>/vnext/react-native-windows` $(MSBuildThisFileDirectory) resolves to
    inside of the package (only when in our repository). Ensure the same name
    is used by external projects to avoid MSBuild from seeing multiple projects.
