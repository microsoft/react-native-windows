# @react-native-windows/cli

CLI to build and run React Native for Windows apps.

## `autolink-windows`

The `autolink-windows` CLI command is used to link the native code and build systems for a React Native for Windows app with any native community modules it uses.

**Note:** Autolinking runs automatically as part of running the `run-windows` CLI command, unless the `--no-autolink` argument is used.

### Usage
Runs Windows-specific autolinking for your RNW project.
  
```bat
npx @react-native-community/cli autolink-windows
```
### Options

Here are the options that `npx @react-native-community/cli autolink-windows` takes:
