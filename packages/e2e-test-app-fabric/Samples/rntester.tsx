/* 
  RNTestApp exports a single ReactComponent, so react
  sees it as a Fast Refresh boundary.  If this module
  imports only RNTestApp, then all edits of any file
  will bubble up the refresh dependencies into
  RNTesterApp, which will be a Fast Refresh boundary,
  and all edits will be treated as Fast Refresh safe.
  Actually many edits in react-native core JS files are
  not safe for Fast Refresh.  In most apps, the root
  file imports react-native, which causes edits within
  react-native to reload the entire instance, unless its
  within a fast refresh boundary within react-native.
  To avoid these issues, we add a dependency edge by
  requiring react-native directly here in addition to
  RNTesterApp
