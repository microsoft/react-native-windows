  # During the official publish (in publish.yml) The stamp-version script that updates the value
  # runs during beachball. But this stayed on the machine that ran the Setup phase and doesn't make
  # it to the machines that run the actual buld. This script does run on those machines
  # and the previous step sets the environment/pipeline variables to the right version
  # So we'll rerun the stamp-version script on each machine that  builds native code so that the 
  # binaries are stamped with the right version.
