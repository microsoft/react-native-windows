          reply: We are not investing in new features or lower priority bug fixes on the C# implementation of React Native for Windows (previously known as "vCurrent"). All investment moving forward is in the C++ infrastructure (previously known as "vNext") and that is the only option as of 0.61 (and was the default as of 0.60). If this issue is still relevant on the modern implementation please open a new issue. If this issue is of significant severity for a vCurrent app and vNext is not an option, re-open with justification.
