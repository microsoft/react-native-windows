<!-- This is a template for new feature or API proposals for React Native Windows. Use this to submit new API/component requests or behavior updates that are specific to Windows-only. For feature requests to React Native, go [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals) instead. 

It's fine if you don't have all the details for the template below: you can start with the Summary and Rationale. Read more about React Native for Windows proposal process [here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/tree/main/vnext/proposals)

Your request will be triaged by the RNW team according to this process: https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/wiki/Triage-Process
-->

# Proposal: [your title here] 
<!-- Add a title for your feature or API proposal. Please be short and descriptive -->

## Summary
<!-- Brief explanation of the new API or change. -->

## Motivation

<!-- Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? Why should this be done for Windows-only?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this proposal is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind. -->

## Basic example

<!-- [Optional] If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Please list any open issues that you think still need to be addressed.
These could include areas you think would benefit from community or the react-native-windows team input -->
