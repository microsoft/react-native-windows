### Reproducible Demo

<!--
  Please share a project that reproduces the issue.
  There are two ways to do it:

    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.
      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.

    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.
      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a Snack.

  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve
  Once you’re done, copy and paste the link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:

(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)

### Additional context

(Write any other additional context that may help in root causing the issue.)
