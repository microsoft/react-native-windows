        Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome? Why should this be done for Windows?

        Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this proposal is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions.
        
        In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.
