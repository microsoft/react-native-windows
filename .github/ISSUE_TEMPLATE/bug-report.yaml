        This form is for reporting bugs found in React Native for Windows.
        
        If the issue is that an existing React Native API is simply missing in React Native for Windows, please use the [this form](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new?template=missing-api.yaml) instead.

        If you just have a question, please post on [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/discussions) instead.

        Your issue will be triaged by the RNW team according to [this process](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/wiki/Triage-Process).
